--------
Abstract
--------

Apache::AntiSpam::SpamTrap is a subclass of Apache::AntiSpam, filter
module to prevent e-mail addresses exposed as is on web pages. This
module adds a Blowfish encrypted string suffix to the local-part of
e-mail addresses. This string contains a timestamp and the IP address
of the remote host. This enables you to identify a spammer's address
harvester by its IP address and take steps to prosecute him.

The encryption prevents faking and may help in a prosecuting attemp.

For example, <apleiner@cpan.org> will be filtered to
<apleiner-78c1ed6da0322b3a@cpan.org>.

This module is Filter aware, meaning that it can work within
Apache::Filter framework without modification.

This work is based on the Apache::AntiSpam::* modules provided by
Tatsuhiko Miyagawa <miyagawa@bulknews.net>. The idea is taken from
Daniel A. Rehbein (http://daniel.rehbein.net/).
